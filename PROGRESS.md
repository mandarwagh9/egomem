# PROGRESS — EgoMem

> **This file is the loop's memory.** Read it first, every run. Trust the files, not your recollection.

## Mission

Invent a **model-agnostic memory layer for robotics**: a neutral
`write` / `query` / `retrieve` layer that BOTH a **world model** AND a **VLA
policy** can call, fed by **egocentric human task video** (LeRobot v3 episodes,
depth, pose). Nothing like this exists as a real artifact yet — in the
literature, memory is baked inside specific VLA models or inside specific world
models, never offered as a paradigm-neutral layer. The closest research bridge
is the **Embodied VideoAgent** line of work (persistent scene memory from
egocentric video). The wedge: **egocentric human video as the substrate for a
buyer-side, model-agnostic memory.**

**End state:** a working library (`/lib`) + a research paper (`/paper`)
documenting a REAL, measured result that supports or kills the core claim.

## The one hard rule

No fabricated, estimated, or "expected" numbers. A number appears in RESULTS.md
or the paper ONLY if THIS loop ran the code and logged it. No run, no number.
Baselines are mandatory. Scale every experiment to the hardware actually
available — a tiny real run beats a large imaginary one.

## Repo map

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `research/` | lit map, gap statement, hypothesis |
| `experiments/` | one folder per run: `YYYY-MM-DD_name/` with raw logs, configs, seeds |
| `lib/` | the eventual library + CLI |
| `paper/` | `paper.md` + figures |
| `RESULTS.md` | append-only, one row per experiment run — NEVER edit a past row |
| `BIBLIOGRAPHY.md` | real sources only, with working links |

## Phase gates

1. **RESEARCH** — lit map; one-paragraph gap; ONE falsifiable hypothesis with a
   named metric, a threshold, and what would falsify it.
   **EXIT:** `research/hypothesis.md` committed with metric + threshold + falsifier.
2. **DESIGN** — spec the neutral interface (`write(obs) -> mem`,
   `query(state) -> retrieved_context`) + the data contract both a world model
   and a VLA can consume; smallest egocentric dataset; baselines (≥ no-memory +
   one naive memory).
   **EXIT:** `research/design.md` with API signatures, data contract, baselines,
   and the single experiment that tests the hypothesis.
3. **EXPERIMENT** — implement the smallest real version + baselines; run for
   real on real/sample data; raw logs to `experiments/<date>_<name>/`; one row
   to RESULTS.md.
   **EXIT:** hypothesis confirmed or rejected with logged evidence.
4. **ITERATE** — analyze the number; change ONE thing; rerun; until stable
   across ≥2 seeds or the iteration budget is hit.
   **EXIT:** a defended result (positive or clean negative).
5. **BUILD** — clean library + CLI; real install; real demo; honest error
   handling. **EXIT:** fresh clone installs and demo runs.
6. **PAPER** — full `paper.md`; every figure traces to a RESULTS.md row; report
   negatives honestly. **EXIT:** paper complete, zero TODO markers.
7. **PACKAGE** — README with repro steps, demo, BIBLIOGRAPHY; then append
   `STATUS: COMPLETE`.

**Iteration budget (phase 4):** max 6 experiment iterations before forcing a
defended-result writeup. Revisit if compute proves cheaper/dearer than expected.

## CURRENT PHASE = 1 (RESEARCH)

### Next single task
Build the **lit map**: survey the named research bridges and the surrounding
work, then write `research/landscape.md`. Concretely, in one bounded run:
- Use the `deep-research` skill (or WebSearch + WebFetch) to find and verify
  REAL sources on: (a) Embodied VideoAgent / persistent scene memory from
  egocentric video; (b) memory inside VLAs (e.g. memory-augmented policies);
  (c) memory inside world models (e.g. recurrent/latent-memory world models);
  (d) egocentric human-video datasets in LeRobot v3 format.
- For each, capture: what memory mechanism it uses, whether it is model-bound or
  model-agnostic, and what substrate feeds it.
- Write `research/landscape.md` with a sources table; add every verified source
  (with a working link) to `BIBLIOGRAPHY.md`.
- Do NOT write the hypothesis yet — that is the run AFTER the landscape exists.

### After that (phase 1 remaining)
Once `research/landscape.md` exists: write the one-paragraph gap statement, then
write `research/hypothesis.md` (metric + threshold + falsifier). That satisfies
the phase-1 EXIT and advances to phase 2.

## RUN LOG (newest first)

### 2026-06-13 — Bootstrap
- **Did:** No prior project existed for this mission anywhere under
  `C:\Users\Mandar` (searched for PROGRESS.md / RESULTS.md / hypothesis.md /
  landscape.md — none found). Created the skeleton repo at
  `C:\Users\Mandar\egomem`: dirs `research/ experiments/ lib/ paper/`; files
  `PROGRESS.md`, `RESULTS.md` (empty, schema only), `BIBLIOGRAPHY.md` (empty),
  per-folder `README.md` placeholders, `paper/paper.md` skeleton, `.gitignore`.
  `git init`. Named the project **EgoMem** (egocentric memory).
- **Finding:** Clean start. Phase 1, no work done yet.
- **Next task:** Build the lit map → `research/landscape.md` (see above).
- **Blocker:** none.
